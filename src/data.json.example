        "question": "Which adaptation helps camels survive long periods without water in the desert?",
        "heading": "Desert",
        "explanation": "Camels have several adaptations for desert life, but their humps specifically store fat that can be metabolized for both energy and water when resources are scarce. Their specialized kidneys and intestines minimize water loss, and they can tolerate body temperature fluctuations and dehydration levels that would be fatal to most mammals.",

        "question": "Which desert animal can go its entire life without drinking water?",
        "heading": "Desert",
        "explanation": "Kangaroo rats have remarkable adaptations that allow them to survive without ever drinking water. Their kidneys concentrate urine to minimize water loss, they produce very dry feces, and they get most of their water from metabolizing seeds they eat. Additionally, they are nocturnal to avoid water loss during hot daylight hours and have specialized nasal passages that reduce water loss during respiration.",
